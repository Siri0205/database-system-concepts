To design a Conceptual Entity Relationship (ER) Model using fundamental database design 
methodology by identifying entities, attributes, relationships, cardinalities, keys, and constraints, 
and to represent them using an ER diagram tool. (drawio, lucidchart) 
Algorithm: 
Algorithm: 
➢ Start 
➢ Understand the Requirements: 
o Read and analyze the problem domain (in this case, a cricket management 
system). 
➢ Identify Entities: 
o List the main objects (entities) relevant to the system. 
o Example: CricketBoard, Team, Player, Match, Ground, Umpire. 
➢ Identify Attributes for Each Entity: 
o Determine characteristics of each entity. 
o Example: Player has attributes like PlayerID, FName, LName, etc. 
➢ Determine Relationships: 
o Identify how entities are related. 
o Example: A Team plays a Match, a Match occurs at a Ground. 
➢ Identify Cardinalities and Relationship Types: 
o For each relationship, define how many instances of an entity relate to another. 
o Example: One CricketBoard organizes many Matches → 1:M. 
➢ Define Keys and Constraints: 
o Assign Primary Keys (PK) for unique identification. 
o Assign Foreign Keys (FK) to enforce referential integrity. 
➢ Normalize and Reframe Relations: 
o Convert the design into a relational schema. 
➢ Design ER Diagram using Creately: 
o Go to https://creately.com/diagram. 
o Use ER template, add entities, attributes, keys, and relationships with proper 
cardinality. 
➢ Save and Export Diagram as needed. 
➢ End 
Question:         
Using basic database design methodology and ER modeler, design Entity Relationship Diagram 
by satisfying the following sub tasks: 
1. a Identifying the entities. 
1. b Identifying the attributes. 
Sample Output:  
CricketBoard(BoardID, Name, Address, Contact_No) 
Team(TeamID, Name, Coach, Captain) 
Player(PlayerID, FName, LName, Age, DateofBirth, PlayingRole) 
Match( MatchID, Date, Time, Result) 
Ground(GroundID, Name, Location, Capacity) 
Umpire(UmpireID, FName, LName, Age, DateofBirth, Country) 
1. c Identification of relationships, cardinality, type of relationship. 
1. d Reframing the relations with keys and constraint. 
1. e Using creately, develop ER/EER diagram 
1.a Identifying the Entities 
The major entities are: 
1. CricketBoard 
2. Team 
3. Player 
4. Match 
5. Ground 
6. Umpire 
1.b Identifying the Attributes 
Sample Output (EntityName(Attribute1, Attribute2,...)): 
1. CricketBoard(BoardID, Name, Address, Contact_No) 
2. Team(TeamID, Name, Coach, Captain) 
3. Player(PlayerID, FName, LName, Age, DateofBirth, PlayingRole) 
4. Match(MatchID, Date, Time, Result) 
5. Ground(GroundID, Name, Location, Capacity) 
6. Umpire(UmpireID, FName, LName, Age, DateofBirth, Country) 
1.c Identification of Relationships, Cardinality, Type of Relationship 
Relationship Entities Involved

1.d Reframing the Relations with Keys and Constraints 
Below are the relations with Primary Keys (PK) and Foreign Keys (FK) defined: 
1. CricketBoard (BoardID, Name, Address, Contact_No) 
2. Team(TeamID, Name, Coach, Captain) 
3. Player(PlayerID, FName, LName, Age, DateofBirth, PlayingRole, TeamID) 
o FK: TeamID → Team.TeamID 
4. Match(MatchID, Date, Time, Result, GroundID, BoardID) 
o FK: GroundID → Ground.GroundID 
o FK: BoardID → CricketBoard.BoardID 
5. Ground(GroundID, Name, Location, Capacity) 
6. Umpire(UmpireID, FName, LName, Age, DateofBirth, Country) 
7. MatchTeam(MatchID, TeamID) 
o Composite PK: MatchID + TeamID 
o FK: MatchID → Match.MatchID 
o FK: TeamID → Team.TeamID 
8. MatchUmpire (MatchID, UmpireID) 
o Composite PK: MatchID + UmpireID 
o FK: MatchID → Match. MatchID 
o FK: UmpireID → Umpire.UmpireID 
1.e Using Creately – Develop ER/EER Diagram 
You can now create the ER diagram on https://creately.com using the above information. 
➤ Steps to create ER Diagram on Creately: 
1. Go to https://creately.com/diagram (Lucidchart) 
2. Select ER Diagram Template 
3. Add entities (CricketBoard, Team, Player, Match, Ground, Umpire) 
4. Add attributes under each entity (underline primary keys) 
5. Draw relationships and indicate cardinality (1:1, 1:N, M:N) 
6. Use connectors and label relationships (e.g., "Organizes", "Plays", "Belongs To") 
7. Save or export as PDF/Image
