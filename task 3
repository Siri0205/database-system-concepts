Aim: To Perform the query processing on databases for different retrieval results of queries using 
DML, DRL operations using aggregate, date, string, indent functions, set clauses and operators. 
• To retrieve the location of a particular match conducted by its MatchID 
• To retrieve the Players detail whose name start with ‘A’. 
• Add a column Batting and Bowling in Player table. 
• To count the number of right-hand batsman in a team. 
• To display the CricketBoard details for the BoardIDs 'BID01', 'BID03', and 'BID06'. 
• To select the names and IDs of players who are left-hand bowlers. 
• To find the UmpireID of umpires who have not umpired any match. 
• To list the PlayerIDs and the total number of matches each player has played. 
Sample output: 
1. Select location from Match where MatchID=’MAC03’; 
2. Select * from Player where Name =’A%’; 
3. Alter table Player add Batting varchar(20), Bowling varchar(6); 
4. Select count(*) from Players where Batting=’right-hand’; 
5. Select * from CricketBoard where BoardID in(‘BID01’, BID03’,’BID06’); 
6. Select PLayerID, Name for Player where Bowling=’left-hand’; 
Queries: 
1. Retrieve the location of a particular match by its MatchID   
SELECT Location FROM   Match WHERE  MatchID = 'MAC03';  -- Filter for the 
required match 
2.  Retrieve the player details whose name starts with 'A' 
SELECT * FROM   Player WHERE  UPPER(Name) LIKE 'A%';  -- 'A%' matches names 
starting with A (case-insensitive) 
3. Add columns Batting and Bowling to the Player table 
ALTER TABLE Player ADD ( Batting VARCHAR2(20),       
right-hand, left-hand  Bowling VARCHAR2(10) );                  -- Stores batting style (e.g., -- Stores bowling style 
4. Count the number of right-hand batsmen in a specific team 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumRightBatsmen FROM   Player WHERE  LOWER(Batting) 
= 'right-hand'        -- Match batting style 
AND  TeamID = 'TID01';                  
(change as needed) 
5. Display CricketBoard details for specific BoardIDs -- Restrict to one team 
SELECT * FROM   CricketBoard  WHERE  BoardID IN ('BID01','BID03','BID06');  -- Matches any of the listed IDs  
6.Select the PlayerID and Name of players who are left-hand bowlers   
SELECT PlayerID, Name FROM   Player WHERE  LOWER(Bowling) = 'left-hand';   -- Match bowling style  
7. Find UmpireIDs of umpires who have not umpired any match 
SELECT U.UmpireID, U.Name FROM   Umpire U  LEFT JOIN Match_Umpire MU 
ON U.UmpireID = MU.UmpireID      
WHERE  MU.UmpireID IS NULL;                                      
match records  -- Match umpires to matches -- Keep only those with no  
8. List PlayerIDs and total number of matches each player has played 
SELECT PlayerID, COUNT(DISTINCT MatchID) AS MatchesPlayed  -- Count unique 
matches per player 
FROM   Player_Match 
GROUP BY PlayerID;                               -- Group results by each player
