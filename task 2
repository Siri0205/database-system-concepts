Aim:  To create  a traditional database using Hierarchical and Network models and convert/enhance it into a relational schema, identify inheritance relationships, perform constraints, and implement using SQL (DDL + DCL).
Question:
Creating Hierarchical /Network model of the database by enhancing the sound abstract data by performing following tasks using forms of inheritance:
1.	a Identify the specificity of each relationship, find and form surplus relations.
2. b Check is-a hierarchy/ has-a hierarchy and performs generalization and/or specialization relationship.
2. c Find the domain of the attribute and perform check constraint to the applicable.
2. d Rename the relations.
2. e Perform SQL Relations using DDL, DCL commands.

Sample output:
Revoke all from user1;
2.	f Using create, design Relational Hierarchical model and Relational Network Model ER diagrams.
1. Scenario for Database Modeling
Domain: University Management System
Entities:
	University
	Department
	Professor
	Course
	Student
Relationships:
	University has multiple Departments (1:M)
	Department offers many Courses (1:M)
	Professor teaches multiple Courses (M:N)
	Student enrolls in multiple Courses (M:N)
Specificity and Surplus Relationships
Specific Relations:
University → Department (1:M)
Department → Course (1:M)

Surplus (Derived) Relations:
	Teaches (Professor → Course)
	Enrollment (Student → Course)
2.b Inheritance Hierarchy and Relationships
	IS-A Hierarchy:
	Person
	Professor
	Student
	HAS-A Hierarchy:
	Department HAS-A HOD (Professor)
Generalization/Specialization:
	Person (person_id, name, contact)
	Professor (professor_id, designation)
	Student (student_id, batch)
2.c Domain and Constraints
Attribute	Domain / Constraint
age	INTEGER CHECK (age BETWEEN 18 AND 60)
email	VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL
course_code	VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY
grade	CHAR CHECK (grade IN ('A','B','C','D','F'))
2.d Relation Renaming for Normalization
Old Name	New Name
Professor	Faculty
Department	Dept
Enrollment	Course_Registration
Teaches	Course_Assignment
2.c: Find domain of attribute + Check constraint
Attribute	Domain / Constraint	
age	INTEGER CHECK (age BETWEEN 18 AND 60)	
email	VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL	
course_code	VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY	
grade	CHAR CHECK (grade IN (‘A’,’B’,’C’,’D’,’F’))	

2.d: Rename the relations
For clarity and normalization:
Professor → Faculty
Department → Dept
Enrollment → Course_Registration
Teaches → Course_Assignment
2.e: SQL Implementation (DDL + DCL)
	DDL – Schema Creation
	 
 
DCL – Permission Control

 2.f: Create Hierarchical & Network Models in ER Diagram (Using Creately or Similar Tools)

Use diamond shapes for relationships and ellipses for attributes. Arrows represent cardinality.
